|[**Day 1: Report Repair**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)|[day1.py](day1.py)| [Two Sum Problem](https://coderbyte.com/algorithm/two-sum-problem) | The input size is small enough to brute-force it using the naive approach.

|[**Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)|[day3.py](day3.py)|-|It's not immediately obvious but the map repeats when you reach the rightmost edge. The tour terminates at the bottom of the map only. This is why the `duplicate` operation is implemented.|

|[**Day 7: Handy Haversacks**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)|[day7.py](day7.py)|[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html), a graph library for Python|Figuring out that it was easier to include the source node itself while recursing took embarrassingly long. The test cases provided really helped debug the solution.
|[**Day 8: Handheld Halting**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8)|[day8.py](day8.py)|[`copy` â€” Shallow and deep copy operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)|In Part 2, `file_new = file` would simply create a reference to `file` in `file_new`, so changing one object changes the other. Therefore, a shallow or deep copy of the `list` objected is needed, which is done using the `copy()` method.
|[**Day 9: Encoding Error**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9)|[day9.py](day9.py)|[`itertools.combinations`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations)|-|
|[**Day 10: Adapter Array**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10)|[day10.py](day10.py)|[`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)|While a brute-force solution worked for the smaller inputs, a [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) approach was eventually needed to solve the larger input size
[[**Day 11: Seating System**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11)]|[day11.py](day11.py)|-|Quickly gave up the idea of dealing with this using 2D lists. `numpy`, `np.flatten()` in particular, was extremely helpful
